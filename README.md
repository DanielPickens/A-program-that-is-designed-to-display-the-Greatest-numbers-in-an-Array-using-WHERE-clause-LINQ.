A program that leverages the Where clause to display the greatest number from an array 


In this program , I  set properties for the object to be constructed where it has already defined the values of ‘array[]’ variable. The where clause is used in a query expression to specify which elements from the data source will be returned in the query expression. The foreach() function is used to print the element values greater than 50.
